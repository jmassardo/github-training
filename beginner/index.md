# 🌱 Beginner Phase: Foundation
**Weeks 1-4 | Understanding Software Development & GitHub Basics**

---

## Phase Overview

Welcome to the beginning of your GitHub journey! This phase establishes the foundation you need to understand how software development works and how GitHub fits into that process.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this phase, you'll understand:

- How software teams plan, develop, and collaborate
- The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and DevOps principles
- Git version control fundamentals and workflows
- GitHub.com platform features and navigation
- Source Code Management (SCM) as a team process
- Planning and collaboration tools (Issues, Projects, PRs)

### Phase Context

**Before:** You're an experienced CSM with strong customer skills but limited software development exposure.

**After:** You'll speak confidently about software development processes, navigate GitHub with ease, and guide customers through basic workflows.
