## The Software Development Challenge

Imagine you're building a house. There are different approaches:

**Waterfall approach:** Plan everything upfront, build foundation → walls → roof → interior in strict sequence. If you discover the kitchen needs to be bigger, tough luck — the walls are already built.

**Agile approach:** Build a basic shelter first (MVP), then iterate with rooms, plumbing, electricity based on what you learn from living in it.

**DevOps approach:** Use automation to test plumbing as you build it, deploy changes quickly, and monitor if anything breaks.

Software development faces similar challenges: changing requirements, complex dependencies, need for quality, and pressure to deliver quickly.

## Where GitHub Fits

GitHub is the **collaboration platform** that enables modern software development by providing:

| Capability | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Version Control** | Track every code change | Never lose work, see history |
| **Collaboration** | Issues, PRs, code review | Team coordination |
| **Automation** | CI/CD pipelines | Faster, reliable releases |
| **Security** | Vulnerability scanning | Proactive protection |
| **Project Management** | Planning boards | Visibility and tracking |
