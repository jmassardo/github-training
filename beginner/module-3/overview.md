## From Local Git to Cloud Collaboration

In Module 2, you learned Git — the version control engine. But Git alone is like having a powerful car with no roads. **GitHub provides the roads** — the infrastructure for teams to collaborate, review code, track work, and ship software together.

## GitHub by the Numbers

Understanding GitHub's scale helps you appreciate its market position:

- **100+ million** developers worldwide
- **420+ million** repositories
- **90%** of Fortune 100 companies use GitHub
- **$7.5 billion** Microsoft acquisition (2018)
- **#1** source code host globally


## GitHub Product Tiers

As a CSM, you'll work with customers across different tiers:

| Tier | Target | Key Features |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **Free** | Individuals, small teams | Unlimited repos, basic features |
| **Pro** | Individual professionals | Advanced tools, insights |
| **Team** | Organizations | Team management, protected branches |
| **Enterprise Cloud** | Large orgs | SSO/SAML, audit log, GHAS |
| **Enterprise Server** | Regulated industries | Self-hosted, air-gapped option |

## The Four Pillars of GitHub

GitHub's value proposition rests on four pillars:

### 1. 📦 Code (Source Control)
- Repository hosting
- Branch management
- Code search and navigation
- File history and blame

### 2. 📋 Plan (Project Management)

- Projects (Kanban/table views)
- Milestones and roadmaps
- Discussions

### 3. ⚡ Automate (CI/CD)
- GitHub Actions
- Packages (artifact registry)
- Pages (static hosting)
- Codespaces (cloud development)

### 4. 🔒 Secure (DevSecOps)
- Dependabot (dependency updates)
- Secret scanning
- Code scanning
- Security advisories


## GitHub vs Competitors

You'll encounter customers comparing options:

| Feature | GitHub | GitLab | Bitbucket | Azure DevOps |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Market share | Dominant | Growing | Declining | Enterprise |
| CI/CD | Actions | Built-in | Pipelines | Pipelines |
| Pricing model | Per-seat | Per-seat | Per-seat | Per-seat |

## Why CSMs Need Platform Fluency

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="1">
<div class="callout-title">💡 CSM Perspective</div>

Understanding the GitHub platform helps you:

1. **Identify adoption gaps** — Are they using Projects? Actions? Security features?
2. **Recommend solutions** — Match customer pain points to GitHub features
3. **Spot expansion opportunities** — Copilot, GHAS, additional seats
4. **Build credibility** — Speak confidently about features
5. **Support customers** — Help troubleshoot without escalating
